<div class="wrapper">
<div class="terms">

<p>TheLotusOnline respects your privacy and works hard to protect your personal information. We want you to understand how we may collect, store, use and protect any personal information. We will not share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. When you registered for our services you agreed to accept this policy. We may change this policy at any time. We will post notifications of revised versions of our policy on our website, and revised policies will be immediately effective. Throughout this Privacy Policy, we will refer to our website and services collectively as the \"Service.\" Please note, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means than your use of the Service (including offline) or from other sources.</p>

<h4>Information We Collect</h4>

<p>When you register for or use a TheLotusOnline account, we collect the following information:
- When you register: we collect your name, phone number, email address, preferred gift method, and other related information.
- Additional information from or about you may also be collected in other ways, including responses to customer surveys or your communications with our customer service team.
**We use technology to help us collect information**</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>It is important for us to track how our website is used, and we (or our service providers) may place "cookies" on your computer or device. Cookies are small data files that identify you when you use our services. You have the option to decline our cookies by using your browsers settings tools, but this may interfere with your use of our website and services.</p>

<h4>Protecting Personal Information</h4>

<p>Any information that can be used to identify a person is \"Personal Information\". This does not include information that has been aggregated or made anonymous. All information is securely stored on our servers in the United States. Our safeguards and procedures have been implemented to maintain the physical and electronic security of our services and your personal information. Our measures include firewalls, system-wide data encryption, physical and electronic access controls, and strict rules regarding the access and use of data on our system.</p>

<h4>Using Personal Information</h4>

<p>We use your Personal Information to provide you the features and functionality of the Service, and may share it with our trusted third parties, to ensure that you have a safe, high-performance experience when using the Service. When you use the Service, including contacting customer service or requesting technical support, in addition to many other interactions with TheLotusOnline, we will apply the information that we have collected. Knowing this information allows us to verify your identity, communicate with you and enforce our agreements with you. We may also use this information to measure how our members use the Service, and improve and enhance our offerings to you.
TheLotusOnline may use certain information about you without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content.
We use cookies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in.</p>

<h4>Sharing Personal Information</h4>

<p>TheLotusOnline will not rent or sell your Personal Information to others. TheLotusOnline may share your Personal Information with members of TheLotusOnline or with third parties for the purpose of providing services to you (such as those described below). If we do this, such third parties' use of your Personal Information will be bound by terms at least as restrictive as this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of TheLotusOnline (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>

<p>Processing payment and deposit transactions requires that we share your personal information with third parties, including but not limited to:</p>
    
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
    <li>Service providers who provide us a range of essential operational services including fraud prevention, transaction processing, collections, direct marketing, and managed technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</li>
    <li>Law enforcement authorities or government representatives who may require us to share information in order to comply with court order and other legal mandates, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to report suspicious activities, prevent physical harm, financial loss, or violations of our agreements and policies.</li>
    <li>Other third parties, subject to your prior consent or direction.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>If TheLotusOnline becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
    
<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, TheLotusOnline will not disclose Personal Information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service and related agreements, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of TheLotusOnline, our Users or others.</p>
    
<h4>Compromise of Personal Information</h4>
    
<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, TheLotusOnline will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, by email, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>

<h4>Your Choices About Your Information</h4>

<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case TheLotusOnline may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account information at any time by logging in to your account. You can review and correct the information about you that TheLotusOnline keeps on file by contacting us as described below.</p>

<h4>Links to Other Web Sites</h4>

<p>TheLotusOnline is not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our website, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>

<h4>Notification Procedures</h4>

<p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our website, as determined by TheLotusOnline in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you.</p>

<h4>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

<h4>Contact us with any questions</h4>
