<h4>Terms of Service</h4>

<p>Welcome to TheLotusOnline. This User Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you ("you," "your") and TheLotusOnline, Inc. ("TheLotusOnline," "we," "our" or "us").
We want to make it easy for you to track and grow your Lotus flower, and have developed The Lotus Track & Grow service (the "Service," more fully described in Section 1 below) to help you. Before you can use the Service, we require that you accept the terms of this Agreement.

If you do not agree with these terms and do not want to be bound by this Agreement, you will not be granted any rights under this Agreement and you may not use or access the Service. Signing up for TheLotusOnline means you accept these terms:</p>

<h5>1. Your License</h5>

<p>TheLotusOnline grants you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense, to electronically access and use the Service solely to track and grow your flower, and to manage the gifts you so receive. The Service includes our website, any programs, documentation, tools, internet-based services, components, and any updates (including website maintenance, service information, help content, or bug fixes) thereto provided to you by TheLotusOnline. You will be entitled to updates to the Service, subject to any additional terms made known to you at that time, when TheLotusOnline makes these updates available.</p>

<p>While we want you to enjoy the Service, you may not, nor may you permit any third party to do any of the following: (i) access or attempt to access TheLotusOnline systems, programs or data that are not made available for public use: (ii) copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, resell or distribute in any way material from TheLotusOnline; (iii) permit any third party to use and benefit from the Service via a rental, lease, timesharing, or other arrangement; (iv) transfer any rights granted to you under this Agreement; (v) work around any of the technical limitations of the Service, use any tool to enable features or functionalities that are otherwise disabled in the Service, or decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Service, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (vi) perform or attempt to perform any actions that would interfere with the proper working of the Service, prevent access to or use of the Service by our other users, or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; or (vii) otherwise use the Service except as expressly allowed under this section.</p>

<h5>2. Ownership</h5>

<p>The Service is licensed and not sold. TheLotusOnline reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement. The Service is protected by copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws. TheLotusOnline owns the title, copyright and other worldwide Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) in the Service and all copies of the Service.

For the purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property Rights" means all patent rights, copyright rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.

You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Service, including without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products ("Ideas"). By submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place TheLotusOnline under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Idea without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, TheLotusOnline does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to TheLotusOnline, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.</p>

<h5>3. Account Registration</h5>

<p>You must register and create a 'Member' account to use the Service. When prompted by our registration process, you agree to (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself, and (b) maintain and update this information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If any information provided by you is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, TheLotusOnline has the right to terminate your TheLotusOnline Account ('Account') and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service.</p>

<h5>4. Protecting Your Information</h5>

You must prevent unauthorized access to and use of any of your information or data used with or stored in or by the Service ('Account Data'). You are responsible for all electronic communications sent to us or to any third party containing Account Data. When we receive communications containing your Account Data, we assume you sent it to us. You must immediately notify us if you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of any Account Data. We reserve the right to deny you access to the Service, in whole or in part, if we believe that any loss, theft or unauthorized use of any Account Data or access information has occurred. You grant us permission to anonymously combine your Account Data with that of other members in order to improve our services to you.</p>

We reserve the right to make any such changes effective immediately to maintain the security of our system or to comply with any laws or regulations, and to provide with notice via email of such changes. We may also perform maintenance on the Service from time to time and this may result in service interruptions, delays, or errors. We will always attempt to provide prior notice of scheduled maintenance but cannot guarantee that notice will always be provided. You may be offered new services that may be in beta and not final. As such, the Service may contain errors and 'bugs' that may result in its failure.

<h5>14. Amendment</h5>
    
<p>We have the right to change or add to the terms of this Agreement at any time, and to change, delete, discontinue, or impose conditions on any feature or aspect of the Service with notice that we in our sole discretion deem to be reasonable in the circumstances, including such notice on our website at http://www.thelotus.online or any other website maintained or owned by us for the purposes of providing services in terms of this Agreement. Any use of the Service after our publication of any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of this Agreement as modified.</p>

<h5>15. Termination</h5>
    
<p>TheLotusOnline may permanently or temporarily terminate, suspend, or otherwise refuse to permit your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in TheLotusOnlineâ€™s sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement. We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to delete all of your information and Account Data stored on our servers if your membership is terminated or if you have not performed in accordance with the community rules and guidelines. Upon termination you must immediately stop using the Service and the license provided under this Agreement shall end. You also agree that upon termination in accordance with this section, TheLotusOnline shall not be liable to you or any third party for termination of access to the Service or deletion of your information or Account Data. The rights and obligations of Section 9 (Limitation of Liability and Damages) and Section 10 (Indemnity), will survive termination of this Agreement.</p>

<h5>16. Assignment</h5>
    
<p>This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by TheLotusOnline without restriction.</p>

<h5>17. General Provisions</h5>
    
<p>Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, these terms are a complete statement of the agreement between you and TheLotusOnline, and describe the entire liability of TheLotusOnline and its vendors and suppliers (including Processors) and your exclusive remedy with respect to your access and use of the Service. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Privacy Policy, this Agreement shall prevail. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it shall be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. This Agreement will be governed by California law as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California, without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles that would require application of law of a different jurisdiction, and applicable federal law. The parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in Los Angeles County, California or federal court for the District of California. Headings are included for convenience only, and shall not be considered in interpreting this Agreement. The Agreement does not limit any rights that TheLotusOnline may have under trade secret, copyright, patent or other laws. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and TheLotusOnlineâ€™s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
